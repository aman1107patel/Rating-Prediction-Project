44,"The laptop performance is great but battery does not last for more than 3 hours in single charge with moderate usage.
Also, the speakers are not adequately loud. You can't hear anything with your ceiling fan turned on.

So be prepared to get a bluetooth speaker with this laptop.

For me 3 hours battery life is okay but the speaker output is really bad.",4

54,"I am casual user of the laptop and no a gamer, so it is good till date. have not find any major issue. Everything is good and running as per expectation.",4
55,JUST SUPERB IN SUCH A LOW PRICE RANGE JUST GO FOR IT .,5
56,"Best deal in this budget 👌, boot in just fraction of seconds, really very very fast, performance wise it's best in segment, N-Vidia Graphics card along with 512ssd, makes ideal for gaming & other hevy tasks, only drawback is battery but we should understand that gaming laptop consume more power, rest of the things you will enjoy for sure. What I wants in a laptop it has all.",5
57,"product is good and performance is very smooth for video editings it not so good get upgrade for high graphic games handles smoothly
heat management is good
battery backup depends on work for heavy use 1hr,40min for less use 4hr for battersaving 5hr
overall expereince is very good",5
58,"Gets the work done, mid range topper
Pros: good battery and processor, less boot time because of ssd, good ventilation, got all the required ports, back-lit keyboard, performance was beats everything..
Cons: heats up too much while gaming and other intensive tasks but not on regular usage, display could be better, keyboard is very compact you need to get used to it, speakers are really low",3
59,I want to say that this laptop is very good for gaming. I have played Gta V and it works very well no lag at all but if you want to play games kindly be sure that the fan vents are not blocked so that the hot air can flow away or else you can face some minor lags on the laptop.,4
60,Everything is fine with the laptop. It's fast to boot smooth in gaming but only setback is it's battery life which is not that efficient even if u r doing normal work on laptop. When u r playing a game then it will drown even faster probably running out in something 1-2 hours. everything else is fine. If u don't mind battery life and just want to play games than u should definitely go for it. It's best gaming laptop in this price range.,4
61,"1. Display Brightness is medium & just ok
2. No Free MS OFFICE
3. Weight of laptop : heavy
4. No bag included or any freebies just laptop & adapter is given
5. Performance is good
6. A good beginners laptop
7. I would rate it 7/10
8. No other choice in market if you need a laptop with good graphics at this price range",3
62,Great deal at this effective price (46k) ... Just hope the audio output of this laptop could be better and otherthen this the laptop is best in the segment ...... It compete with 60k laptops,5

293,"I'll give a detailed review below.
Pros-
Good battery backup because of U series,
Can handle top games which none does in the price segment,
-Build quality is good,
-Can be used for long term
-Cooling system is good
-Premium look,
-180° hinges

Cons-
-Speakers are not loud compared to others,
-Too heavy and bulky,
-No levels in backlit,
-Screen bleeding (common, cannot be termed as an issue)
-Charger comes from an other Chinese company (135watt),

Definitely a good option. Just go for it.",4
294,"(Reviewing after 3 weeks of usage)
Bought this laptop for coding and some casual gaming. I haven't seen any major issues till now. Display is good, build is decent, performance is top notch and battery backup is great unlike other gaming laptops. Only issue that I think I'll face is storage, for which you can use an external storage. I'm not a gamer but I've played some games and it does get warm while playing and I think that's normal.",4

312,"My Opinion
Amazing product. Totally worth the price paid for. I've been using the laptop for a month now. Haven't observed any issues so far. Comes with a power efficient processor which does heavy duty tasks effortlessly. However, prolonged gaming is not recommended as it heats up after 4-5 hrs of usage. Regular day to day tasks work like charm. A must buy for Students, Office users and occasional gamers",5

705,"Initial thoughts :
*The system is smooth and steady .
*Not very colour accurate screen tho it's it's excellent for the price .
*144 hz does helps in browsing etc .
But i can clearly see the places where the software isn't optimised for 144hz refresh rate .
* Run a few game - highly recommend to upgrade the ram to 16 or 32 for better gaming .
**No web cam .",5
706,In this price range you will get many laptops but this is best . Because :- 512gb ssd comes with 8 gb of ram and 4gb graphics card ssd and ram card is expendable .

Single core is 1.4k
It handles everything and for 4-5 yrs use it is a better option
Ram is 8gb 3200Mhz and windows uses about 3.4-4gb of it so u should think of upgrading to 16gb or more so that u don't stuck at using heavy ram eating applica...

Great thermals, good battery, great power. JUST WORTH THE PRICE!",5

1st - Doesn't support HDMI output through NVidia GPU but only through Intel GPU, so can't play games on bigger screen
2nd - Thermals are pretty average, since MSI decided to show 2 fans in pic but in reality it only has 1 fan, Shame on you MSI for falls advertisement.
3rd - GPU is severely underperforming even for a 3050 thanks to it being limited to 40 Watt TDP, 3050 can have max TDP of 80 Watt and achieve much higher clock speed, 60-65 Watt power should have been fine with 2 fans a...

Battery performance is also a bit of a concern.. But considering, it's a fast processor with high performance.. The battery usage can be justified..

The laptop gives decent performance in the current AAA titles at high to ultra settings, but sub-par performance in RTX enabled games.

CPU by nature tends to run hotter compared to current gen Ryzen CPUs, but undervolting can solve the problem to some extent at the expense of some performance.

The best thing about this laptop is the processor, usually in this price range you get the i5 10300H which has 4 cores but this one has 6 cores and it can easily compete with an i7 10750H. The GPU works well with most games, I play CS and get about 200fps on medium settings. Hasn't really thermal throttled till now.

Overall great value for money for people who want good processing power on a budget.",5

That's why we wait for Big Billion Sale.

The best thing, 6 core processor and good graphics card, 256 ssd along with hdd.

Set battery to 60% maximum charge limit, and use it on main power unless you really need to use the battery; and Tada, you get 5 to 7 years long battery life. Just discharge and charge battery once every 3 months.

People said everything else.",5

If your prize range is 50k to 60k then plz check pavilion also that is a better version of this one but around the prize range of 50k this is perfect !!",5
3564,"Good laptop. This is my first laptop so I don't know about price to performance ratio, but as a moderate user it is best for me. Just a con that it doesn't have anti glare screen and it makes lot of difference so just keep that in mind. And if I do some netpicking aluminium build will be nice

If you to purchase a laptop and has a 50k budget, go with gaming one they will give the best bang for your buck.

If I still have 50k and asked to purchase a laptop I will never consider it now. So yeah...

1650Ti (8-10% more efficient than 1650)
144Hz
512Gb SSD (much faster than hdd)
1.9 Kg (slightly less than others in this range)
Cooling (better because all air vents are open)
Battery

I was confused b/w Lenovo Ideapad Gaming 3, Asus Tuf F15 & this one.
I suggest you to buy hdd+ssd Or ssd. There is only 3k difference between 512gb ssd and 1 tb hdd variant.

Cons:
Only white light (no control over light) ( a15 has rgb)",5

4041,It keeps freezing in between,3
4042,Smail size,3
4043,The quality of the laptop body is questionable. If you lift this laptop from the right end the lower part of the body made from cheap plastic makes sound. The laptop hinges are very bad. After few months it can break. Also the speaker makes some constant noise when played any video from YouTube. Also the laptop is china made. So if you went for dell thinking its a non Chinese brand thats not the case. Better go for HP or Lenovo.,2

It would be great if there is an option for a higher storage variant. because, excluding the disc c, the only usable storage is 130gb or so which is insufficient these days. but the screen and the speakers are worth it! the vertical real estate is great for ms office apps.",4

A few of the basics missing, like battery charge threshold, outdated and basic bios, function key lock, and fan not jumping high enough even if they're capable. Rest everything is great.

5072,"Honest review-
Bought this for 53k
If you have used and other offices laptop then you may feel battery is not lasting long but it is enough for a gaming laptop, 3 hrs for normal usage
Display is also good but can't satisfy you.
But performance is good no doubt abt that.
Turbo mode works only when charger is plugged in.
Cooling fan is ultimate. I feel the turbo sound. love this fan so much.
Great looks.
Best of luck Asus

I have switched from Nitro 5, and this has far better thermals.",5
5159,"In 1lkh you can say right laptop to go with.

Pro:
Display
Keyboard
Built-in

Cons:
Overheating if want to utilise maximum potential of its GPU
Sound quality is reasonable.


If you are casual Gamer and not thinking to overclock than it is the right laptop in this price range",4
5160,Great VFM for gaming! Especially when on sale.,5
5161,Nice,5
5162,A beast performance wise. RTX 3060 delivers and the display is superb as well. The only con with it is the battery. Can't squeeze more than 2 hours of battery.,4

Display is super,
I purchase in BBD sell at only 88k,

Purchased at 1.06 lakhs in 1st week of May, faced no problem until now. At the time of purchase, it was one of few laptops having NVIDIA RTX 3060. Most laptops in this price segment were using older NVIDIA RTX 2060 or 2070 variants.",5

Other than the
1) battery life
2) body of the laptop getting toasty while gaming
3) noise the fan makes while in turbo mode

can't think of any cons.",5
5171,Awesome laptop but it gives little electric shock when on power.,5
5172,"It is good product but acer should have to upgrade the cooling system
Only 2 heatsink pipe because of bad cooling system they have underclock the cpu and GPU , you need to have cooling pad",4
5173,"Got it under 1L, should have been 1TBSSD instead of HDD, display is good, battery is very poor as with most gaming laptops however build quality is also average when compared to HP, dell etc. Overall just Satisfied",4
5174,"Only cons I found
1. Major thing is about speaker-even though we purchase a premium laptop the sound quality is very poor not audibible and not at even loud atleast. The budget laptop speakers are far better
2. Battery is draining fast.
3. Heating issue you should always put on a table.
4. There is no type-c charging you can only use for file transfering
5.Attracts the finger prints and oil easily need to have a good maintainance
7. Sometimes the turbo button is not working.
6. Last thing...

Other than this... It's perfection for the price range(Rs. 1.14 lakh)",5
5189,"A great performing laptop, the 110W RTX 3060 GPU performs really well and easily outputs more than 60fps at 1080p at max settings. The i7 10850H is a perfect companion for gaming. The laptop has decent overclocking headroom and the thermals are pretty good with vents at the bottom for intake. A cooling pad will keep it even cooler.",5
5190,"Overall very good price to performance ratio.
With upgrades like RAM and a SSD, the laptop would be even better - has extra empty slots for the same.
Doesn't heat up much while gaming. Sound is average.
Pro Tip : Uninstall Nvidia Drivers and reinstall them through System Updates, significantly increases fps in games.
Definitely Recommended for anyone looking for a value for money laptop.",5

Realme accidentally added an extra 0 in front of 5. Making it 50MP instead of 5MP. Front camera also not good. I am using realme phones since laat 4 years , cameras are always their major buying point, but narzo 50a has it as a greatest drawback.

I bought 6gb/128gb varient which is recommended if you buy this mobile. Lower varients varies with some hardware eg. storage type.
If you can't break the budget line of 12k then today I can say that this is the best smartphone under 12k.
If you can spend a minimum of thousand or more to buy a smartphone then it is not the best choice because better processors available at 13k smartphones.

Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.

If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.

Battery is great and charging takes about 2 hr 15 min as it has 6000 mah battery.

Display is also good produces good colours.

-Battery life from its 6,000 mAh is great. Supports reverse charging but strangely we still get impure USB C cable & USB A charger, so one needs to buy & carry a pure USB C cable seperately.

1.The camera is awesome

1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.

Realme accidentally added an extra 0 in front of 5. Making it 50MP instead of 5MP. Front camera also not good. I am using realme phones since laat 4 years , cameras are always their major buying point, but narzo 50a has it as a greatest drawback.

6090,I don't know why company has claimed the camera is of 50 MP. It's as good as 20 MP only. Rest of the things are good but not according to price. In that case Samsung phones supersedes the realme with the same price. I am little disappointed to opt it.,3
6091,"Utterly disappointed...I was excited by seeing the battery is 6000 mah and camera 50 mp but actually it's below average performance and it takes very long time to get charged fully and if we Google any website it's not opening, really it's nightmare for me, I feel like the company is cheating by giving wrong features",1
6092,"Literally, camera sukcs!!!!
Realme accidentally added an extra 0 in front of 5. Making it 50MP instead of 5MP. Front camera also not good. I am using realme phones since laat 4 years , cameras are always their major buying point, but narzo 50a has it as a greatest drawback.
Rest all things are as per specification shown.

Go for it if u are normal user and multitasker because it has 6 gb of ram which is very good. The Sd 662 is not a great processor but it is good for daily usage and at this price it is acceptable.

If u are looking a phone for camera then this is not a great choice. It produces darker images.

6215,"Very nice phone and the most best thing is that it is the best phone under 12000 whoever reads my coments, I suggests you to buy this phone by eyed closed. You cannot find such a good phone under 12k. Thanks.",5
6216,One of the best Smart Phone at this rate. I grabbed the best deal at this price.,5
6217,"Well,this is a good budget smartphone in 10k.
1.The camera is awesome
2.The battery life is so good
3.The performance is nice
4. The phone heats up little up when playing high ram consuming games like gangster Vegas but I love the game boost feature it instantly cleans up the phone when playing the game
5.Finally it is a very good phone to buy at 10k",5
6218,"Good product. Best product under this value of cost. Heating is the only issue found when charging and usage while playing games. Otherwise nice product. Battery backup remarkable, 1 day for heavy using and 1³/4 nearly 2 days for moderate using. Camera is some what deserving. I'm using this for one month. You can also prefer Poco M3 if u are satisfied with my knowledge of choice.",5
6219,"Hi, I purchased POCO M3 on 20th feb 2021. I feel if you are looking for a good budget smartphone with 64/128 GB memory at an affordable price, then this is it. Camera is okay, I would say it's average, but other things like battery, memory storage and size, display are all good. I watched a few reviews from Gaurav choudhary-technical gurujii, geeky ranjit and others to name a few before going in for this phone. Value for money and without ads,",5
6220,"This is my first POCO phone. Great device. Awesome display. 6gb big ram. Touch is very good. Nice battery. Normal camera, is not super. But overall, this mobile phone is attractive. I like it. Actually POCO is the Xiaomi's brand. OK.",5
6221,awesome mobile with smooth performance battery life is wonderful if talk about its sound that is far better than big brands like samsung...overall this mobile is a dhamaal package in budget....go for it guys,5
6222,"I'll give this mobile to 3.5 rating because:

1. Camera-- I had seen the comments during purchasing that many people told about its camera not good as expected by them. But one thing I want to remind them, if they want best camera quality like 64 Mp or more, then they will have to understand that 48Mp is good at this price base. So, my suggestion is that the Emptor will go buy regarding this price. Hence, I am giving 4 out of 5 star for Camera quality.

2. Display---- Quality is best, I thi...

6223,"A very good mobile with bad camera. Everything is fine, the battery lasts atleast one day for any kind of user. Display is 1080p and at this price range is a real steal. Processor is Snapdragon 662 which is enough for most of gamers also. Starts with base model 6gb ram and 64 gb storage. The MIUI12 is good but still, there are some lags and frame drops only because of the UI. Coming to camera, this mobile has the worst front facing camera. It's completely useless in my opinion.

The phone Heating is a big problem and also charger.
When you plugged the charger for 1hour the heating of the charger looks like, you charged the charger for 10hour. Charger and phone heating is not normal..

7441,Good battery. Decent camera and we cannot expect more in this price and 5g it has less bands think so. Not a good 5g phone.. Performance is Good. No lag but didn't tried heavy games.

Display is very big and better......
According to me it's best and top #trending1 Android Phone.",5
9471,If You considered the price tag then it is the best option around 8k budget with a large display and great battery with decent cam and 4gb 64 gb variant... U no need to think twice before purchasing this ph in this price. Completely value for money,3
9472,"Battery : is best
Display : Perfect
Sound : on speaker low but Okay
Performance : Awful, phone is superslow.. if you ever use 4GB/6GB ram phone then you realise how pathetic ... Older 3/32 still better than this..
Camera : Front is awful, like 3k china phone
Back : like old 3MP camera. Do not expect photography.

Earphone : Not include.

9722,"I will say if you are with budget and you want best phone under 8000 then you are at the correct place becozz. U will get best thing under this ...
3gb ram and 32 gb storage with powerful g35 processer the performance of the phone will never make you down ..
Also with its 13mp triple camera the photos that are captured is amazing ..

This is a worrying factor. Moreover it does not have Radio inbuild.

11970,I'm writing this review after 4 days of using this phone. According to the price this phone is excellent. Battery life is amazing. Lasts about 2 days after charging. Display is good. Sound quality is not that great but its okay. There are some amazing advance features. A bit heavy though. Overall this is an amazing phone in this budget.,5
11971,Camera is not so good . Battery is not like 6000 mah . Only phone look is good .,4

11974,This mobile f12 is absolute value for money with a excellent battery back up uptown 5 days but it is very thick and the display of this is not as much better but satisfying and the front camera is also not good but overall performance of this mobile is excellent in this price range.so if you are think of buying it then your choice is correct.,4
11975,The camera optimization is very poor. The 48Mp's photo looks like captured from 2Mp camera and the macro shot is nightmate. But yaa seamless experience as compared to Xiaomi or any other Chinese phones as there are no ads and the UI is light and it feels very fast in using. The battery is a plus point for this phone. I personally liked the UI as compared to MIUI with no bloatwares and ads popping out in middle of the work which is in the case of MIUI,4
11976,Good features and camera quality is good and powerful battery and nice and auto call recorder option is also available if don't want auto call recorder option manual call recorder option is also available but the problem is we should have click tow time to open any thing other good phone value of money and most recommended,4
11977,This Phone is awesome in this price point it has some graet features and I liked this Phone The display is HD+ but it fells like FHD+ the colurs and contrast are very good.And also the delivery boy was very cooperative,5
11978,"Great Product , If You want to buy a new branded phone and you have only a less amount in your hand , then no problem just buy this and use its fantastic. I Bought a Black one , that's great in real but not good in photos...",4
11979,It's a good midranger. Apt for someone looking for a second phone or for your parents or kids. Feels solid. Looks decent. 90hz refresh is a plus. The camera perform well enough. I personally love One UI so definitely a good buy. The drop notch looks a bit dated but other than that over-all it's okay.,5
11980,"I gifted this to my mom on my 1st salary from my 1st job. She's really happy although she wasn't very positive about the cost. She believed she could use a cheaper one. Now, how do i tell her that nothing is more valuable than her love.",5

Don't look at the negative comments if you are not a heavy gamer (Pubg, Call of Duty, etc.). Light gaming like Subway Surfers, Temple Run runs very smoothly in this phone.

face unlock and finger print sensors were pretty fast and accurate
it detects 2.4ghs and 5GHS wifi band

12686,"Battery is good, display is good.
I like a lot it isa very nice moddle look wise also too good camera quality is also too good. Thank you so much Flipkart.",5
12687,"Phone is superb
But it would have been better if the fast charging was given and if the camera section is improved by replacing the 2MP & AI otherwise the phone is very good at this price range.
Battery is very good, Display is awesome .",5
12688,"It's the best spec overloaded phone under 10000 budget.
It's has a large display that you can watch movies play games just experience like a gaming PC. It has absolutely ultra smooth display of 90Hz refresh rate . I love this phone. INFINIX is know what we need.
But it has a demerit of HD+ display but it's not so big deal. I have run PUBG Mobile around 8 hours non-stop and the battery still left 15% if buy this phone you will not regret yourself.
Best mobile in 10,000.

Pros_
1. Display resolution and quality is pretty balanced.
2. Xos is quite easy and handy to use.

Cons_
1. Charger is 10W only. ( It took almost 3 hours to charge 100% ).
2. Night camera performance is average. ( Not cons for me but it should be slightly good yet).
3. 90hz smoothness might me more better ( but though under 10 it is understandable)

Good photos with an average HDR.
Photos are quite bright
Even the front camera is more clear

Battery

This battery is also 4500-5000 mah range so...it w...

12912,"It's similar to realme 3(yeah I know it's the sub brand of oppo) by the looks but, realme 3 has far more superior camera and processor when compared to this model, looks and design wise both are similar. Writing this review after a week

* Supports portable Hotspot for both bands bands 2.5 ghz and 5ghz
* Good battery life lasts for 1.5 days for normal usage(like WhatsApp, instagram)

12914,"coming to design it is good and the back design is also grippy which is nice to hold in hands,
coming to performance which is quite good for daily usage,
the biggest advantage of this phone is battery back up, it was excellent
face unlock and finger print sensors were pretty fast and accurate
it detects 2.4ghs and 5GHS wifi band

i don't recommend this for heavy gamers who used to play PUBG,COD,FREE FIRE ETC..., we can play normal games like temple run,subway surf etc,...,

13044,Best product for the budget under 15000. I am using this phone from last 20 days and their is no problem at all the sound quality is best but the battery and the charging support is best in this phone There is a 30 Watts Dart charger which charge 0 to 100 percent in almost 70 minutes. I advice people's whose budget is lower than 15000 to buy this phone this is a very good product in this range.,5
13045,"45 days after purchase:-
Go for the phone if performance is a priority for you. You'll be going to take some beating at camera and screen quality (but it's decent enough),90 fps is great for bgmi. Go for the 128/6 GB version,as it's the cheapest in the segment. Conclusion:- If you like you're phone to be non laggy,fast switching between apps,great gaming experience, decent fast charging (30W charger charges 0-100 in 70 mins),and good battery backup,and you're not a camera person who likes to ...

I'm writing all the pros and cons that personally i faced and felt.
First of all I would like to tell you about the cons :-
1. Battery life is normal, not for gaming one.
2. Camera's Night mode doesn't work properly.

13134,Best product for the budget under 15000. I am using this phone from last 20 days and their is no problem at all the sound quality is best but the battery and the charging support is best in this phone There is a 30 Watts Dart charger which charge 0 to 100 percent in almost 70 minutes. I advice people's whose budget is lower than 15000 to buy this phone this is a very good product in this range.,5
13135,"45 days after purchase:-
Go for the phone if performance is a priority for you. You'll be going to take some beating at camera and screen quality (but it's decent enough),90 fps is great for bgmi. Go for the 128/6 GB version,as it's the cheapest in the segment. Conclusion:- If you like you're phone to be non laggy,fast switching between apps,great gaming experience, decent fast charging (30W charger charges 0-100 in 70 mins),and good battery backup,and you're not a camera person who likes to ...

Camara quality is too good in this price range and display also. Battery performance is good but not best. Phone performance good for normal working like editing, social working and much more.

Cons
It heat slightly when charging

No 5g
There are many stock apps like mi pay etc which are useless
No amoled

Pros
Sd 860
120hz
33 watt fast charging
3mm jack
Notification led
Front camera impressive
Stereo speaker

13570,"The Poco X3 Pro has set yet another benchmark in the mid-range segment with its class-leading performance. The phone offers lag-free performance, which is what gaming aficionados mostly prefer. The vibrant stereo speakers and the high-refresh-rate display just adds to that fluid experience. But while the phone yields a power-packed performance, the cost-cutting factor is clearly visible in the display and camera segment. If you are looking for a complete package, then Poco X3 Pro's dull displ...

14328,Best part of the phone is one ui experience. Don't go for redmi phones which shows hardware gimmicks. This phone is best at this price range. Image processing is overall good and performance is excellent. Battery backup is too good. Easily last for two days and more with normal usage. No heating problem on high brightness. Phone is comfortable to hold and weight distribution is fairly done.,5
14329,Superb phone with superb look and quiet wonderful performance..fully satisfied with this great purchase from well prominent brand samsung...,4
14330,"Display is amazing, although it has HD+ sAmoled u cant find any issue in day to day life
Performance is not as much good .but if u r not a havy user then it is okay
The most loving thing about this mobile is its OS. ONEUI core 3.1 .. u can feel the smothness better than realme and redmi .. and its keyboad also impressed me
When talk about camera ..i cant say very good but decent ..",4
14331,"Reviewing after a week of use, first my use is only limited to YouTube, light gaming along with heavy calling. Battery backup is just amazing in one full charge it will stay upto 48 hrs which includes 8 hrs YouTube watching and gaming. This phone is for users like me who used it for binge watch as display is very good for watching videos. Sounds great when used with headphones 🎧 as it has dolby atmos feature.",5
14332,"Good display, battery good, camera ok for price. but if u r claiming as 48 mp then came should be good. Flipkart packing should improve no bubble wrap? Overall good buy.",4
14333,The best cheapest AMOLED phone available in indian market. Everything good but compared to MIUI Samsung UI is not that great. Rest Hardware wise all good. Better than Realme and Redmi devices,5
14334,Its a good allrounder smartphone but if you are looking it just for display purpose its display is decent but not the best. So for better display go for m21 2021 edition but you have to compromise on performance and 90hz refresh rate there.,3
14335,"⭐⭐⭐⭐/ 5
Overall this device is value for money 💰..
Camera is good as compared to other brand (realme, mi, vivo) at this price range .
Battery is massive.
Display is good , this is HD amoled screen which give you true colour in screen as compared to other brand.
6.4 inch screen is perfect for me..
Build quality is very good",4

Only thing is product did not handle well.

Over all Nice phone Gifted to My sister and she likes it a lot.",4
14337,"Battery🔋 backup is pretty good, though fast changing isn't actually fast enough to charge this 6000 mah battery. Camera could have been far better for this 48 MP lense. Phone performance is pretty good. Front camera 📷 is only average. Can opt this out if battery life and display quality only matters for some standard budget branded phone.",4
14338,"Delivered a day before due date thnks to flipkart overall phone is good and decent at this price range which i got for mere rs.10500 inc.bank and card offers.performance wise it is good and above all the brand value of Samsung matters more than any thing else.

Even at this price range no other company gives super amolod screen panel even though it is not full hd that does not matter.processor is well optimised all though...

14340,"If you are planning on to buy a budget smartphone this can be one !! Though the display could be better .
But at this price point we can adjust with it . The super amoled and monster battery takes it to next level . If you are a normal user it can be one of the best in the market . However with the chipset it is coming , it is not recommended for gamers .

Overall this device is value for money 💰..
Camera is good as compared to other brand (realme, mi, vivo) at this price range .

4. Despite being Moto mobile there are no Moto gestures
5. No mention about android update",4

14879,Best product for the budget under 15000. I am using this phone from last 20 days and their is no problem at all the sound quality is best but the battery and the charging support is best in this phone There is a 30 Watts Dart charger which charge 0 to 100 percent in almost 70 minutes. I advice people's whose budget is lower than 15000 to buy this phone this is a very good product in this range.,5
14880,"45 days after purchase:-
Go for the phone if performance is a priority for you. You'll be going to take some beating at camera and screen quality (but it's decent enough),90 fps is great for bgmi. Go for the 128/6 GB version,as it's the cheapest in the segment. Conclusion:- If you like you're phone to be non laggy,fast switching between apps,great gaming experience, decent fast charging (30W charger charges 0-100 in 70 mins),and good battery backup,and you're not a camera person who likes to ...

Camara quality is too good in this price range and display also. Battery performance is good but not best. Phone performance good for normal working like editing, social working and much more. But not for gaming like BGMI, CODM, Free fire. Processor (G-95) got heated during playing game. Overall good performance in this price range. If you see gaming device in this price range go for POCO X3 PRO(SD860)",4

14999,Best product for the budget under 15000. I am using this phone from last 20 days and their is no problem at all the sound quality is best but the battery and the charging support is best in this phone There is a 30 Watts Dart charger which charge 0 to 100 percent in almost 70 minutes. I advice people's whose budget is lower than 15000 to buy this phone this is a very good product in this range.,5
15000,"45 days after purchase:-
Go for the phone if performance is a priority for you. You'll be going to take some beating at camera and screen quality (but it's decent enough),90 fps is great for bgmi. Go for the 128/6 GB version,as it's the cheapest in the segment. Conclusion:- If you like you're phone to be non laggy,fast switching between apps,great gaming experience, decent fast charging (30W charger charges 0-100 in 70 mins),and good battery backup,and you're not a camera person who likes to ...

Camara quality is too good in this price range and display also. Battery performance is good but not best. Phone performance good for normal working like editing, social working and much more.

Short Review: If your main priorities are stock android, a good processor and a decent camera, go for it.

There are other brand phones which are cheaper than this and with better specs. But I chose Moto over them as Moto phones are more durable and the specs of this phone is not bad at all for this price.
My suggestion - Go with G40 6gb version instead of G60 as you won't find much of a difference between the photos taken by both the phones.",5

The step count is totally wrong and also the calories count doesn’t add up. Heart rate and SpO2 isn’t accurate either. Also in most of the product images, it looks like the blacks are deep so the thick bezels won’t bother, but in person it’s completely opposite.

Better than boat xtend or noise smartwatch.

SP02 tacker needs optimisation and calibration
When using sports mode _ you can't access to other features like music controls or camera controls or SPO2 measurement",5

Good battery life,

Disconnects the watch too often, (It is the major drawback)

Pros :-
1. The watch has a sturdy built and nice removable straps. Gives a premium look
2. It has a blood oxygen sensor(spo2) which is very important in this covid time.
3. The heart rate monitor also works fine. Nearly accurate results.
4. The accelerometer ( step count) also works fine if you are walking over 20 steps. For below 20 steps it doesn't count many of the times. But that can be ignored coz above 20 it gives accurate results in walking and running.

2. I do not care about the heart rate and the oxygen monitor but atleast expect the pedometer to be working. The pedometer counts steps even when the watch is taken off and is at rest.
3. The battery lasts for approx 4 days even when the automatic heart rate, stress and spo2 are turned off.
4. The app hangs most of the time and also drains the battery of the mobile.
5.There are only about 20 watch faces available. The modifiable watch faces ...

17707,"If you are looking for some large display size then don't go for it. In terms of looks it's pretty good. And the functions like heart rate,oxygen level etc are showing approximate results. Rise to wake function is bit slow.
But it's overpriced now I,e 2999. During the first sale it's price was 1499 which is worthy. During an offer I got it for 1999. Under 2k it is worth to buy. But not beyond that price.",3
17708,"Good product, perfect for tracking sports. I found the health related features to be inconsistent. Also the sync between the app and the watch is a bit snappy sometimes hence not able to set custom watch faces.

If you are in the market for an entry level fitness tracker, this will do just good!!",4
17709,"Nice product. I got it for 2000 rs only .battery is good and charging also..display is average..not good..the display is far far better on amazefit bip u..if u a crisp and hd display lover ,add some money and go for amazefit bip u..you will love it.Apart from display everything else is really good",4
17710,The features are not that much godd if you compare with amaze fit or noise pro 3 but at this price segment it is perfect i bought it at 1999 rs in sale and i personally think it is the cheapest smart watch with the features like spo2. So it is value for money.,3

At this price it was a very good quality watch, No other brands provide watch of this specification at this price
It was a very very low weight watch.
The another pro's of the watch is that it provide all the measurements ( heart rate, blood pressure etc) accurate.

Also the sports feature of the watch is good enough,

At the end I tell you that, don't confused with another brand just go for it.

18022,Beautiful watch. Gifted this to my husband and he loved the watch and colour as well. A must buy product for gadget lovers..!!,5
18023,"The watch feels really comfy and attractive in the hand. The Realtime Heart monitor and other features such as oxygen level monitor stress level indicator and so on meets the expectations. The cons I felt is that the watch faces weren't that attractive and the battery level is not as promised. It drains off quickly. Last only 3-4 days, when it was promised for 10days. Overall it's a good smartwatch at a decent price.",4
18024,"The watch looks soo good, but the noisefit application often disconnects the bluetooth to the watch which makes it to loose the 5 star rating.

Pros: Watch faces are good,
Good battery life,
watch interface is so smooth and well designed,
Heart rate monitor, SPo2, stress monitoring sensors works well

Cons: Noisefit app is worst
Disconnects the watch too often, (It is the major drawback)
Strap is not too extraordinary but just ok.",4
18025,"I couldn't ask for more from this product. Elegant and stylish. Data accuracy and connectivity and tracking is par excellence.
Rose gold color suits the best for me.

18028,Looks and feels nice and premium with great features. I really love the stress monitor and spo2 sensor. It's ui needs to improve though and add some more face watches... overall it's a good quality budget smartwatch.,5
18029,Design wise very good. After one month use it starts slow responding for calls and notifiactions. I think its need to be upgarde with faster reponse. Otherwise its very easy to use and looks very comfortable on my hand.,4

1. Good Budget watch almost accurate SPO2, HR and sleep Tracking

1.Battery Drainage issue...
100 to 82% in just 10 minutes.

3.Vibration when notification recieved is very irritating.
4.Limited watch faces.
5. Plastic casing",3
18031,"Considering the cost of the smart watch, this is an easy go kinda accessory with adequate specs.

18050,Nice budget smartwatch with basic features. It lags a bit sometime when 2 or more activities going around at the same time. But looking at the price I would say a very good product to vouch on. Also the mobile application is very detailed and help me track my activities after linking the same with Apple Health. A very good product to wear when in move.,4

18052,It is a nice product. Good value for money. Activity tracker works perfectly. Heart rate monitor and SpO2 works smoothly. Little improvement needed in call and message push. Hope quickly noise will resolve this update. Suggest buy at this price range.,5
18053,"Review after 7 days of usage:
Pros :-
1. The watch has a sturdy built and nice removable straps. Gives a premium look
2. It has a blood oxygen sensor(spo2) which is very important in this covid time.
3. The heart rate monitor also works fine. Nearly accurate results.
4. The accelerometer ( step count) also works fine if you are walking over 20 steps. For below 20 steps it doesn't count many of the times. But that can be ignored coz above 20 it gives accurate results in walking and running.

2.Display siz is only 60-70% of dial

5. Music player control is working bad, it doesn't show the song information like sec, song name, pause/play.
I have get a option for return the watch, but I don't because I like the build and notification",1

19375,The real life smartwatch i bought it @1799 only . Each and every feature is best from others in market . This is my third smart watch and also best thanjs gioone . Don't think too much just buy even its price increase up to 2500@ till this price worth it for us.,4
19376,"This is a good watch. Though the cover/box of watch doesn't say it, but it measures Blood oxygen as well. It's accuracy is decent (difference of +/- 2 from medical device which monitors oxygen). Heart rate is also decent in accuracy when compared to medical device and Apple watch, not 100% but difference of only 4-5 beats per minute. NOT RECOMMENDED for medical purpose.",4
19377,"Good looking watch with dull features. Provided with only 4Watch Faces in which Advertising watch face looks okay but Missing with Battery Indicating logo. Monitors like BP, Heart Rate, O2 are not accurate and can't trust. Screen may be provided with bit bigger, Since lot of empty space in top & bottom.",3

19528,"Review after 7 days of usage:
Pros :-
1. The watch has a sturdy built and nice removable straps. Gives a premium look
2. It has a blood oxygen sensor(spo2) which is very important in this covid time.
3. The heart rate monitor also works fine. Nearly accurate results.
4. The accelerometer ( step count) also works fine if you are walking over 20 steps. For below 20 steps it doesn't count many of the times. But that can be ignored coz above 20 it gives accurate results in walking and running.

20036,"Wonderful watch!!

I have been using this watch since last few months.

First of all, I would wish to speak about its looks.... The build quality of the watch is quite good, it gives you an impression of wearing an Apple watch. Many of my colleagues have asked me about it and they looked really very interested to buy this. It is a light weight watch, the faces of the dial are supercool but there are only a few.. there is a need to have more watch faces to add more versatility to this smart wa...

Apart from that the product is simply superb...!!!",4
20041,"Overall good product 1st talk about screen you really need to increase screen size and curve the angle, overall build quality is good and innovative. You can increase price but make a little bit good PPI screen. Except tht anything is very good.",4
20042,Device looks excellent. I had lot of mixed reviews before buying this device. Finally I feel like I took the right decision. Worth the money spent. The reason why I am giving 4 stars is the app that is used to pair the device needs some updates to be done,4

5) Notification display is good

21008,"Review after 7 days of usage:
Pros :-
1. The watch has a sturdy built and nice removable straps. Gives a premium look
2. It has a blood oxygen sensor(spo2) which is very important in this covid time.
3. The heart rate monitor also works fine. Nearly accurate results.
4. The accelerometer ( step count) also works fine if you are walking over 20 steps. For below 20 steps it doesn't count many of the times. But that can be ignored coz above 20 it gives accurate results in walking and running.

21125,I am writing this review after using for 7 days. And its fantastic battery lasts for 4 days with normal use and fitness tracking is also awesome and accurate. Over all good experience will recommend to friends,5
21126,the usp of this watch is the screen quality which is really a class apart. But an addition of SPO2 sensor and built in Alexa within this price range would have made it a clearcut winner among the sub 10k competitors. Also missed the reject call with custom message option which is available in bip u & bip u pro. Its screen quality and screen protection is better than the GTS 2 mini according to me which is available at 1k more.,5
21127,"Wow just woww.. Amazing watch in 2021 also at price 5300 rupees...What a Beautiful amoled screen so bright... And best part very comfortable watch... More than 500 watch faces can be installed with third party apps..

21128,One of the best smartwatch in the market. Its an old model from 2019 but still it has all the basic functions. Amazing display with vibrant colours. Descent battery. Good activity tracking. Its a good buy for under 5000. Anything above that rate is not recommended.,5

I don't know whether individual watches vary battery backup. When i read other reviews tell 16days I have this opinion.

21131,"The display quality is the best ! Size is little smaller, but best fit. Strap not the best, May be can purchase another one. Battery backup so far best on first day experience. Hear rate sensor is not accurate as it shows data for table also. LED display clarity is the best once again.",5
21132,"I knew that there's no spO2 sensor still I purchased it as in 6k , it is excellent value for money product with Amoled display, excellent battery back up (no fast charging) with stunning looks ( golden colour). There's still room for improvement for Amezfit service & UI as it is just good & works fine.
Overall very happy with the purchase.",5
21133,"BUILD QUALITY: Build quality is terrific. Doesnt look like cheap quality. Weight balance is good.
DISPLAY: Display is the main picture in this watch. This AMOLED display makes this watch to look like a premium watch.
ACTIVITY TRACKING: Tracking is not so accurate. Considering the price point they should have given more accurate. There is no SPO2 tracking on this device which i can say its a major con at this price point.
VALUE FOR MONEY: I can give 4 out of 5. Its Only because of activity tra...

4. Accurate measures of calories burnt during workout.
5. Records all the previous workouts in the watch itself. The same can also be monitored form Zepp App.

Wonderful product!! Go for it!",5
21238,"Purchased this last week, I am very impressed with the performance of the watch so far. This review will be pretty elaborate, hope it answers your questions.

First things first, battery is amazing - with over 100 notifications, music control, all day heart rate monitoring, intense workouts and GPS tracking the device lasts about 8 days. ( Assuming linear discharge rate)
Music controls work just fine but could be better. Workout tracking is precise and data is accurate (as compared to data wi...

21245,I am writing this review after using for 7 days. And its fantastic battery lasts for 4 days with normal use and fitness tracking is also awesome and accurate. Over all good experience will recommend to friends,5
21246,the usp of this watch is the screen quality which is really a class apart. But an addition of SPO2 sensor and built in Alexa within this price range would have made it a clearcut winner among the sub 10k competitors. Also missed the reject call with custom message option which is available in bip u & bip u pro. Its screen quality and screen protection is better than the GTS 2 mini according to me which is available at 1k more.,5
21247,"Wow just woww.. Amazing watch in 2021 also at price 5300 rupees...What a Beautiful amoled screen so bright... And best part very comfortable watch... More than 500 watch faces can be installed with third party apps..

21248,One of the best smartwatch in the market. Its an old model from 2019 but still it has all the basic functions. Amazing display with vibrant colours. Descent battery. Good activity tracking. Its a good buy for under 5000. Anything above that rate is not recommended.,5

The display is pretty sharp and Always on display make it even better",5

First I thought price range is not good and felt high of features
It's stunning display is eye catching both in day light and looks awesome in night.
Battery 🔋 100-50% in 4 days , with continuous heart rate & sleep monitoring, app notifications without call lifting , 1hr workout per day.
I don't know whether individual watches vary battery backup. When i read other reviews tell 16days I have this opinion.

21251,"The display quality is the best ! Size is little smaller, but best fit. Strap not the best, May be can purchase another one. Battery backup so far best on first day experience. Hear rate sensor is not accurate as it shows data for table also. LED display clarity is the best once again.",5
21252,"I knew that there's no spO2 sensor still I purchased it as in 6k , it is excellent value for money product with Amoled display, excellent battery back up (no fast charging) with stunning looks ( golden colour). There's still room for improvement for Amezfit service & UI as it is just good & works fine.
Overall very happy with the purchase.",5
21253,"BUILD QUALITY: Build quality is terrific. Doesnt look like cheap quality. Weight balance is good.
DISPLAY: Display is the main picture in this watch. This AMOLED display makes this watch to look like a premium watch.
ACTIVITY TRACKING: Tracking is not so accurate. Considering the price point they should have given more accurate. There is no SPO2 tracking on this device which i can say its a major con at this price point.
VALUE FOR MONEY: I can give 4 out of 5. Its Only because of activity tra...

It is always this and that when it comes to the value for money aspect. Above that the watch us well designed, amazing display and activity tracking is top notch as well. The ability of the screen to be scratch proof is cherry on the top.

About the watch, it works as expected. Seamless experience with any of the android phones. It would be much better with a Samsung phone.

21417,I bought this phone with an assumption that ecg monitoring is available. But it was not easy to understand that you need a glalaxy smartphone for the same. Buy only if you have galaxy phone and are willing to use that going forward. So I paid a premium for features which are available in other watches at a much lower price.,2
21418,"So far so good, (review after 2 days) :

The watch is woking fine as of now. The package is reasonably sealed. Seems genuine. The product is made or assembled in India. Since, its an Indian varient warranty claims (if any) shouldn't be an issue.

The watch is quite relevant in 2021 also. Since, smartwatch is not a segment where you have new hardwares everyday. SpO2 sensor is probably the only think you could miss in 2021.

It auto detects your activity, which I find quite useful.

About the watch, it works as expected. Seamless experience with any of the android phones. It would be much better with a Samsung phone.

It's a bit expensive, doesn't have a premium feel, display resolution is low, around 3500/- would be a better price.
But having said that, the watch does the job.",3

I am a Tech Reviewer, I would rate the product as below,

Design - 4/5

Speaker and Mic quality - 3/5

21845,Don't buy this watch if you are looking for app specific notifications!! Also there are no software updates from the company!! You can select either notifications from all apps or from none !! Such a stupid watch to have !!,1
21846,"Looks are okay, calling feature is extra, other features available is less expensive options. Hand lift to wake is not smooth. App can have more options.
It's a bit expensive, doesn't have a premium feel, display resolution is low, around 3500/- would be a better price.
But having said that, the watch does the job.",3
21847,"Hi All,

I am a Tech Reviewer, I would rate the product as below,

Design - 4/5
Software -3.5/5
Speaker and Mic quality - 3/5
Battery - Haven't tested so far
Display - 3.5/5
Features - 4/5

Overall a decent watch for the price range. Below things could have been better,

Software needs to be little more Optimization
Price could have been little less
Display could have been better",4

21858,"Design is very good. But it's toy watch with calling opinions only. Other BP, heart rate, SPO2, sleep trackers are fake and will give you random pre programmed values. To verify it, pl keep watch on floor and start taking all above readings, it will show values within normal range.",2

What I didn't like was that the Bluetooth calling feature. What they have cleverly done is that the watch connect to the phone via Bluetooth and essentially becomes a Bluetooth speaker. So if I answer the call, the default answering mode becomes the watch... Even if I attend on the phone. The range is around 5 meters. If the distance goes up, and you get a call, the watch se...

Reviewing after owning smart watches like, fossil, Michael kors, huawei GT, G-shock.

So I purchased 2 of these in a weeks time for gifting. The watch is having 5 stand out features.
1. The looks are to die for. The finish feels so superb. Feels very elegant on wrist.
2. The amoled screen is perfect to look at. HD screen is what we want in today's tech.
3. Run tracker is accurate and is good with too many functions.

Colour: Beige

The watch looks cool on both male and female with a very elegant design. The watch faces are awesome in the zepp app. It tracks workout pretty accurately. It is really waterproof and I have tested it for about 5 times by dropping it into a bucket full of water. You can get the notifications on this watch but cannot reply to them and cannot even answer call but you can decline or mute it. The thing it lacks is a SPO2 sensor. Connecting to GPS on this watch ...

It is always this and that when it comes to the value for money aspect. Above that the watch us well designed, amazing display and activity tracking is top notch as well. The ability of the screen to be scratch proof is cherry on the top.

No doubt it resembles apple watches but I really don't care untill and unless it's made well and serves my purpose.

amoled screen make it nice in looks
features wise also good, watch faces are available in good numbers in app.
strip is glossy which is best thing to bear, very soft.
Do not buy if you hv budget around 8000-10000, go for other products coz u will get calling feature.
But if u are in 7000 budget then this is better option.

4. Accurate measures of calories burnt during workout.
5. Records all the previous workouts in the watch itself. The same can also be monitored form Zepp App.

Wonderful product!! Go for it!",5

Music controls work just fine but could be better. Workout tracking is precise and data is accurate (as compared to data wi...
